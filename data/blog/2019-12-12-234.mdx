- AWS re:Invent 2019: [REPEAT 1] BPF performance analysis at Netflix (OPN303-R1)
- Extended BPF (eBPF) is an open-source Linux technology that powers a whole new class of software: mini programs that run on events. Among its many uses, BPF can be used to create powerful performance-analysis tools capable of analyzing everything: CPUs, memory, disks, file systems, networking, languages, applications, and more. In this session, Netflix's Brendan Gregg tours BPF tracing capabilities, including many new open-source performance analysis tools he developed for his new book "BPF Performance Tools: Linux System and Application Observability." The talk also includes examples of using these tools in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) cloud.

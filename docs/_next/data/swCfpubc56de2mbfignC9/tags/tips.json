You’re not sure what to do, or how to approach it, or what to say when the company says “how much do you want?” or “here’s our offer—what do you say?” Here’s the thing: that final conversation about salary might be the most nerve-wracking part, but the negotiation process starts much much earlier.

In particular, I’ll be talking about: An example from early in my career when I negotiated very very badly. The right way to negotiate, based on four principles: Employment is a negotiated relationship. Knowledge is power. Negotiate from a position of strength.

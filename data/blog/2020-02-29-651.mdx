哪位大佬知道　integer performance 和 floating point performance　分别指的是什么概念？

我在下面文章中　1.3.1. Let’s look at the data　看到这个概念，没理解

To me, rather than the step change we saw in the 2012 data, I’d say that  _single core_  performance is approaching a limit. The numbers are  slightly better for floating point, but for us in the room doing line  of business applications, this is probably not that relevant.

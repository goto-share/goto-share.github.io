In this paper, the author introduces a new memory storage layout to use column-oriented storage for better compression and faster query execution strategies. they reference lots of database design include Dremel Powerdrill etc. (Describe in Section 2.1)

Highlight you need to know in this paper:

1. General query performance of Scuba in real facebook business. (section 1)
2. Why they use heap not directory use Memory Mapping. (before section2)
3. Deploy Architecture. How data load to cluster and why so fast. (at start of section2)
4. How they decide which storage layout to use. (before section4)
5. we advise read the conclusion after reading section1(introduce) to find out which aspect of the database design you interested in.
- 5.1 how scuba copy data

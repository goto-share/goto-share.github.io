- Building Microservices with Spring Cloud
- Microservices. What does it mean in practice? The answer, like so many Facebook status updates, is complicated. In broad strokes, microservices offer a refreshed approach to application architecture. Microservices are a new way to describe many of the patterns that have fallen out of large-scale applications in practice over recent years. There is no doubt that the approach works. The question is: How does one build a microservices architecture? Join Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long for this event introducing the Spring Cloud project to support building cloud-scale and cloud-ready microservices. Spring Cloud builds on Spring Boot and makes developing complex distributed systems and microservices a snap.

    An animated introduction to the Fourier Transform. Help fund future projects: https://www.patreon.com/3blue1brown An equally valuable form of support is to simply share some of the videos. Special thanks to these supporters: http://3b1b.co/fourier-thanks Learn more about Janestreet: https://janestreet.com/3b1b  Follow-on video about the uncertainty principle: https://youtu.be/MBnnXbOM5S4  Interactive made by a viewer inspired by this video: https://prajwalsouza.github.io/Experiments/Fourier-Transform-Visualization.html  Also, take a look at this Jupyter notebook implementing this idea in a way you can play with: https://github.com/thatSaneKid/fourier/blob/master/Fourier%20Transform%20-%20A%20Visual%20Introduction.ipynb  ------------------ Animations largely made using manim, a scrappy open-source python library.  https://github.com/3b1b/manim  If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.  Music by Vincent Rubinetti. Download the music on Bandcamp: https://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown  Stream the music on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u  If you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then "add subtitles/cc".  I really appreciate those who do this, as it helps make the lessons accessible to more people. ------------------  3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

One of the reasons is to achieve lower latencies. That makes a lot of sense when you are sending short bursts of data that should be delivered as quickly as possible. But what about large files, such as videos? Surely there is a latency penalty for receiving the first byte, but shouldn’t it be smooth sailing after that?\n","slug":"2020-05-27-826"},{"title":"Internet Protocol - IPv4 vs IPv6 as Fast As Possible\n","date":"2020-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","draft":false,"tags":["youtube","network"],"summary":"IPv4 vs IPv6...

(Or indeed by throwing away the application state and replaying all events with the correct event in sequence.) The same technique can handle events received in the wrong sequence - a common problem with systems that communicate with asynchronous messaging.\n","slug":"2020-02-29-635"},{"title":"Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach\n","date":"2020-02-29T00:00:00.000Z","draft":false,"tags":["network","book"],"summary":"入门的话这本不错，不知道有没有中文版 https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-Approach-7th/dp/0133594149\n","slug":"2020-02-29-654"},{"title":"Digital Communications Protocols\n","date":"2020-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","draft":false,"tags":["google","security","network"],"summary":"Security & Privacy,Compatibility Active,TLS,Open Client ,Open Server,On Premise,Anonymous,E2E Private,E2E Group,E2E Default,E2E Audit,FIDO1 / U2F,Desktop Web,Mobile Web,Android,Apple iOS,AOSP,Win,macOS,Linux <a href=\"https://matrix.org/\">Element/Matrix</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nccgroup.tr...\n","slug":"2020-02-14-575"},{"title":"List of TCP and UDP port numbers\n","date":"2020-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","draft":false,"tags":["wikipedia","tcp","udp","network"],"summary":"Wikimedia list article\n","slug":"2020-02-04-521"},{"title":"Why can only root listen to ports below 1024?\n","date":"2020-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","draft":false,"tags":["network"],"summary":"","slug":"2020-02-04-523"},{"title":"naabu: A fast port scanner written in go\n","date":"2020-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","draft":false,"tags":["github","golang","network"],"summary":"A fast port scanner written in go with a focus on reliability and simplicity.

Hi all 
today we are going to share a new paper about druid.

http://static.druid.io/docs/druid.pdf

It's related to the previous share about scuba.
They are all column-oriented database storage. 
Like scuba, The Druid database also has an in-memory data storage strategy.

Highlights:

1. Database module roles. (include Real-time node, Historical Nodes, Broker Nodes, Coordinator Nodes)
2. A complex but very useful time window design for storage "segment" in memory.
3. read data from Kafka and can be query in multiple hundred milliseconds after event happen.

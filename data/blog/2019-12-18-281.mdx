- You Suck at Excel with Joel Spolsky
- (a private presentation to Stack Overflow, Trello, and Fog Creek)
- The way you are using Excel causes errors, creates incomprehensible spaghetti spreadsheets, and makes me want to stab out my own eyes. Enough of the =VLOOKUPs with the C3:$F$38. You don't even know what that means.
- Notes are located at the Trello Board https://trello.com/b/HGITnpih/you-suck-at-excel

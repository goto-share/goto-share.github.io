    In this video, we will open up your smartphone and take a look at the inside of the memory storage microchip. This same microchip is also used to store data in solid-state drives, or SSDs in your computer, in tablets, and inside flash drives. The technology is called VNAND or V-NAND, and it's incredible how engineers were able to fit such an insane amount of memory storage capacity in such a small space

- Have you ever wondered how your smartphone can store countless pictures, songs, or videos?  Or, have you wondered when you download a podcast to your smartphone, where does it actually get stored?  In this video, we will open up your smartphone and take a look at the inside of the memory storage microchip.  This same microchip is also used to store data in solid-state drives, or SSDs in your computer, in tablets, and inside flash drives.  The technology is called VNAND or V-NAND, and it's incredible how engineers were able to fit such an insane amount of memory storage capacity in such a small space.

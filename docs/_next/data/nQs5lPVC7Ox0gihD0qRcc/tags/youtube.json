Or, have you wondered when you download a podcast to your smartphone, where does it actually get stored?  In this video, we will open up your smartphone and take a look at the inside of the memory storage microchip.  This same microchip is also used to store data in solid-state drives, or SSDs in your computer, in tablets, and inside flash drives.  The technology is called VNAND or V-NAND, and it's incredible how engineers were able to fit such an insane amount of memory storage capacity in such a small space.

These are the episodes in the series:  1) [18min] Overview on how SSDs / VNAND / Smartphone storage works.  2) [3min] Quick/Abridged episode of the overview  3) How charge trap flash works.  (details on a single memory cell)  4) How strings of memory cells work (details on a stack of memory cells)  5) How a massive array of memory cells are organized. (Terabit Cell Array Transistor, TCAT)  6) How is VNAND manufactured?  7) Possible episode on an analogy using a city & apartments to explain VNAND.

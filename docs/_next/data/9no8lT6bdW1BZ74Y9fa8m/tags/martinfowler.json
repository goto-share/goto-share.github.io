(Or indeed by throwing away the application state and replaying all events with the correct event in sequence.) The same technique can handle events received in the wrong sequence - a common problem with systems that communicate with asynchronous messaging.\n","slug":"2020-02-29-635"}],"tag":"martinfowler"},"__N_SSG":true}

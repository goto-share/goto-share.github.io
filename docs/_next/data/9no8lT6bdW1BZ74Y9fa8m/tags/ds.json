However, certain basic functions such as key indexed access to records remain essential. While we exploit the common architectural layering of prior systems, we make radically new design decisions about each layer. Our new form of B […]\n","slug":"2020-05-27-800"},{"title":"Lockable Tree - Google Interview Question\n","date":"2020-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","draft":false,"tags":["ds"],"summary":"Lockable tree is a great programming interview question asked by Google, and it is a very well thought out one. A lockable tree is a tree with nodes that can be locked if none of its ancestors and descendants is locked. In the question, we are asked to implement locking/unlocking operations that should run in O(h) time where h is the height of the tree. Lock/unlock methods do not need to be thread-safe.\n","slug":"2020-05-27-807"}],"tag":"ds"},"__N_SSG":true}

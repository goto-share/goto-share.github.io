- Debug Running Pods
- This page explains how to debug Pods running (or crashing) on a Node. Before you begin Your Pod should already be scheduled and running. If your Pod is not yet running, start with Debugging Pods. For some of the advanced debugging steps you need to know on which Node the Pod is running and have shell access to run commands on that Node. You don't need that access to run the standard debug steps that use kubectl.

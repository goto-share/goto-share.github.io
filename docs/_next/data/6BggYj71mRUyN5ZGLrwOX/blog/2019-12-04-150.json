Special thanks to these supporters: http://3b1b.co/fourier-thanks Learn more about Janestreet: https://janestreet.com/3b1b  Follow-on video about the uncertainty principle: https://youtu.be/MBnnXbOM5S4  Interactive made by a viewer inspired by this video: https://prajwalsouza.github.io/Experiments/Fourier-Transform-Visualization.html  Also, take a look at this Jupyter notebook implementing this idea in a way you can play with: https://github.com/thatSaneKid/fourier/blob/master/Fourier%20Transform%20-%20A%20Visual%20Introduction.ipynb  ------------------ Animations largely made using manim, a scrappy open-source python library.  https://github.com/3b1b/manim  If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.

I really appreciate those who do this, as it helps make the lessons accessible to more people. ------------------  3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.
